		<h1> Introduction </h1>
		<p>
			This guide will teach you how to generate the feelings commonly referred to as love in another human.
			The truth is that if you can get somebody to meet with you for a cup of coffee, you can get them to fall in love with you. Which people?

		<p>
			What love is and how it works from a purely biological standpoint:
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="ex">
				Eating a cake feels good. It feels good
				from purely subjective reasons. But we can get outside of our subjective
				experience and study cake making from an objective standpoint. We can learn all about baking and flavors and which flavors go together, how much sugar, what type of sugar.
				Then once the cake is finished, that we've studied and baked objectively, we can switch back to the subjective experience and enjoy the cake.
			</span>
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="ex">
				All the philosophy, poetry, drama and heroic journeys you now associate with the idea of love are all
				from an internal, subjective experience. Being able to switch from the
				subjective, internal experience, (internal to the situation) to an objective,
				outside looking experience, is an extremely valuable and versatile skill to
				have. Many are stuck on one or the other. They experience the emotional
				side, and never suspect that there is an objective way to see things. We all
				have known people who were in bad relationships, bad jobs, bad situations.
				We could easily see they were bad from the outside looking in. But from
				their internal viewpoint, they thought it wasn't so bad, maybe even good

				One of our greatest skills, which is unfortunately also one of our greatest
				weaknesses as humans is our ability to deceive ourselves. No doubt this was
				a very useful skill to have back during the harsh times of hunters and
				gathers. Ignoring negative factors was often the critical thing that pushed
				our species forward. Unfortunately, it is common to be in situations where
				ignoring the negatives and continuing to push forward is the worst possible
				choice. Remain as objective as possible.

			Once you are back inside the subjective experience, you will fully feel them from the subjective experience.<br>
			We are humans who feel human emotions. The human emotions are triggered by specific things that come in through our five senses.<br>

			Movie studios and advertisers take a general message and
			deliver it on a large scale and get a consistent, repeatable result. You will
			learn to take your message and deliver it in a much more targeted, much
			more refined way.

				As with any complex perceptual-motor skill, what's required is that the task be organized into small pieces or chunks, so that you can practice each small chunk individually until you've mastered it. Once you have succeeded in practicing each chunk to the point that it becomes an automatic, effective, unconscious skill, you are free to attend to new possibilities: other components of the task. You can then practice these new chunks until they also achieve that same status of an unconscious, effective, perceptual-motor pattern that you do not have to give any conscious attention to.

			<a style="font-weight:bold">2) the repertoire(Modeling)</a><br><span class="para">
				What we do for a living is an obscure thing called modeling. When we model, we try to build descriptions of how to do something. As modelers we are interested in two things: one is asking really good questions about what needs to be known, and the other is making descriptions of what seems to work. It's something akin to writing a cookbook.
