		<h1> Learning Concepts </h1>
		<h2><a id="C1"> 1. Eye accessing cue </a></h2>
		<p> It can be very useful to divide thinking into the different sensory modalities in which it occurs. When we process information internally, we can do it visually, auditorily, kinesthetically, olfactorily, or gustatorily.</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 1) Visual remembered, V<sup>r</sup> </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Seeing images of things seen before, in the way they were seen before.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">  2) Visual constructed, V<sup>c</sup> </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Seeing images of things never seen before, or seeing things differently than they were seen before.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 3) Auditory remembered, A<sup>r</sup></a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Remembering sounds heard before.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 4) Auditory constructed, A<sup>c</sup></a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Hearing sounds not heard before.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 5) Auditory digital, A<sup>d</sup></a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Talking to oneself.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 6) Kinesthetic, K</a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Feeling emotions, tactile sensations (sense of touch), or proprioceptive feelings (feelings of muscle movement).
			</span>
		</p>

		<h2><a id="C2">2. Objects </a></h2>
		<p>
			It is the same as any skill that can be learned.<br>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">1) Patterning </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				As with any complex perceptual-motor skill, what's required is that the task be organized into small pieces or chunks, so that you can practice each small chunk individually until you've mastered it. Once you have succeeded in practicing each chunk to the point that it becomes an automatic, effective, unconscious skill, you are free to attend to new possibilities: other components of the task. You can then practice these new chunks until they also achieve that same status of an unconscious, effective, perceptual-motor pattern that you do not have to give any conscious attention to.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">2) the repertoire(Modeling)</a><br><span class="para">
				What we do for a living is an obscure thing called modeling. When we model, we try to build descriptions of how to do something. As modelers we are interested in two things: one is asking really good questions about what needs to be known, and the other is making descriptions of what seems to work. It's something akin to writing a cookbook.
			</span>
		</p>

		<h2><a id="C3">3. Amplifier  </a></h2>
		<p>
			You can elicit more intense responses from people. You should avoid what kidnds of things made it harder like below.<br>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">1) Seperated words </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Seperated words make it hard to go back to the state of consciousness that you were in when you actually had the experience you mentioned.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">2) Being incongruous</a><br><span class="para">
				When something he said was incongruous with what I had been thinking
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">3) Suggestions</a><br><span class="para">
				When they suggest several things at the same time.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">4) Speed</a><br><span class="para">
				If one person had slowed down the speed of his voice, and then the other one speeded up, that brought me back up.
			</span>
		</p>

		<h2><a id="C4">4. Leading Method</a></h2>
		<p>
			It is working with only a word that describes the tools that you use to systematically take someone into an altered state of consciousness.<br>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">1) Altered state </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				People go into altered states all the time. Perhaps at lunch you can get in an elevator and ride up to the top of this hotel with some people whom you don't know, and watch what happens to them. People don't get into an elevator and act the way they do normally. They kind of go "on hold" and watch the floors go by. In fact, if the door opens before they're ready to get out, very often they'll wake up and start out. How many of you have walked out of an elevator on the wrong floor? There’s a universality to that experience.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">2) Natural Sequence </a><br><span class="para">
				Smooth transitions make it possible for the person to easily go into an altered state. Connecting words like "as" "while" and "and" make your transitions graceful. Matching someone's breathing with anything in your behavior—whether it's your own breathing rate, the tempo of your speech, or anything else has a very powerful impact. Hypnosis itself, as far as I'm concerned, is simply using yourself as a biofeedback mechanism.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">3) The confusion technique </a><br><span class="para">
				There are ways to induce an altered state by jarring someone as well. Both ways of using communication can induce altered states. People often use what is called the confusion technique as an induction procedure. When you use the confusion technique, you do not build in meaningful transitions. You induce a state of mild confusion in people, and then you begin to build natural transitions from that point.
			</span>
		</p>

		<h2><a id="C5">5. Description </a></h2>
		<p>
			Restrict yourself to descriptions of what must be there in sensory experience and to be non-specific.<br>
			<span class="para">
				* Note that<br>
				Matching someone's breathing with anything in your behavior whether it's your own breathing rate, the tempo of your speech, or anything else has a very powerful impact.
			</span>
		</p>
		<h2><a id="C6">6. Ericksonian </a></h2>
		<p>
			It means developing the skills of a hypnotist so well that you can put someone into a trance in a conversation in which the word hypnosis is never mentioned. There are usful tools as belows.<br>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">1) Rapport </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Rapport seems to be built on matching behaviors. Disagreeing with people won't estab- lish rapport. Talking faster than people can listen won't build rapport. Talking about feelings when people are making visual images won't build rapport. But if you gauge the tempo of your voice to the rate of their breathing, if you blink at the same rate that they blink, if you nod at the same rate that they're nodding, if you rock at the same rate that they're rocking, and if you say things which must in fact be the case, or things that you notice are the case, you will build rapport.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">2) Pacing </a><br><span class="para">
				If your words match the person's experience, you will build rapport.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">3) present experience </a><br><span class="para">
				It makes your statements credible by describing what has to be there in the present experience.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">4) Hallucinations </a><br><span class="para">
				It can be used as tools to accomplish other ends, but they are not themselves that valuable.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">5) Smooth transitions </a><br><span class="para">
				You need to have a graceful way of guiding someone from his present state into a trance state going from describing the state you want him to go to. <br>
				<a style="font-size:12px; line-height:250%">
					* Trance is a state of semi-consciousness in which a person is not self-aware and is either altogether unresponsive to external stimuli (but nevertheless capable of pursuing and realizing an aim) or is selectively responsive in following the directions of the person (if any) who has induced the trance.
				</a>
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">6) Sensory-based information  </a><br><span class="para">
				It allows you to make transitions and elicit responses that induce altered states. The sensory base for transitions needs to be something that the person with whom you are working can find. It doesn't need to be something he already has in awareness, but something that he can find.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">7) Logic  </a><br><span class="para">
				I used to think that it was the logic of that kind of statement that made it convincing. That is part of what makes your statements effective, but more than being logical and convincing these statements are a set of instructions about what’s plausible. That plausibility becomes easier for people to respond to when they stay in a constant, uninterrupted state of consciousness.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">8) General signs of trance  </a><br><span class="para">
				First facial asymmetry, then more than usual facial symmetry. General muscle relaxation, small involuntary muscle movements, flushing, changes in breathing pattern.
