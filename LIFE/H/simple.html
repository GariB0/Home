		<p>
			What physiological signs accompany an altered state of consciousness:<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a class="ex">
				at least some of the distinctive changes in muscle tonus, breathing patterns, skin color, lower lip size, etc., in the person you were putting into an altered state.
			</a>
		</p>
		<h2><a id="C1"> 1. Basic Principle </a></h2>
		<p>
			The basic principle of doing a hypnotic induction is to watch for the physiological signs of developing altered states, and to do anything you can to amplify those signs.
			There are also specific ways of proceeding.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">Generalizations & patterns </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Patterns that you can use which are likely to lead in the direction of altering someone's state. <br>
				I remind you that all the generalizations we offer are lies: that is, they will not work for every person or at every time.<br>
				Always give up a generalization or a pattern in favor of what is actually being presented to you in the way of sensory feedback.<br>
				We will be presenting these patterns to give you specific ways to proceed. <br>
				As you proceed, if you see signs of trance developing in the other person, continue; what you are doing is working. <br>
				If you don't see those signs developing, do anything else.

		<h2><a id="C2"> 2. Verbal Pacing & Leading </a></h2>
		<p>
			Milton Erickson often described trance as having an inward focus of attention. By gradually increasing the number of internally-oriented statements, you use pacing and leading to shift the person's attention inward.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 1) Start by making five statements:</a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Four which are sensory-based, and then one which is internally oriented. Connect them with some transitional word like "and" or "as."<br>
			</span>
		</p>
		<p class="ex">
			For example:<br>
			"You are listening to the sound of my voice and you can notice the colors in the room as you feel your arm on the chair and you can begin to have a sense of contentment."
			Then you make three verifiable statements followed by two non-verifiable, then two and three, one and four, and at that point you should have a fairly nice trance state developing.
		</p>

			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 2) What constitutes a non-sensory-based description of an internal experience</a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Four which are sensory-based, and then one which is internally oriented. Connect them with some transitional word like "and" or "as."<br>

		<h2><a id="C3"> 3. Identifiers </a></h2>
		<p>
			Identifiers are used to name variables and functions and to provide labels for certain loops in JavaScript code.<br> For portability and ease of editing, it is common to use only ASCII letters and digits in
			identifiers. <br>
			JavaScript reserves certain identifiers for use by the language itself which is called reserved words.<br>
			<a class="para_list">
				<br>
				For example, The words, such as 'break','do',etc, cannot be used as identifiers.<br>
			</a>
		</p>

		<h2><a id="C4"> 4. Optional Semicolons </a></h2>
		<p>
			Client-side JavaScript does not exhibit the nonlinear cross-reference problem nearly to
			the extent that the core language does, and it is possible to learn how to use JavaScript
			in web browsers in a fairly linear sequence.<br>
		</p>
		<h2> * Basic Concepts </h2>
		<p> The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of elementary rules that specifies how you write programs in that language.</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 1) Syntax of an language </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				It is the rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language.

			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 2) Unicode character set </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				Unicode, formally The Unicode Standard, is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.<br>
				<a class="additional"> * The standard defines as of the current version (15.0) 149,186 characters covering 161 modern and historic scripts, as well as symbols, etc.</a>

		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold"> 3) Identifiers </a><br>
			<span class="para">
				An identifier is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the "object" or class may be an idea, physical countable object (or class thereof), or physical noncountable substance (or class thereof).
