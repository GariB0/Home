			<a style="font-weight:bold">1) the basic hardware & software components that make up the Internet</a>
		</p>

		<p class="ex">
			The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world.
			The term computer network is beginning to sound a bit dated, given the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet.
			In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called hosts or end systems.<br>
			End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches.  <br>
			There are many types of communication links, which are made up of different types of physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. 
			Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second. <br>
			When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. <br>
			The resulting packages of information, known as packets in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.<br>
			packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. 
			Packet switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in today’s Internet are routers and link-layer switches.
			the types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destinations. <br>
			Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are typically used in the network core. <br>
			The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path through the network.<br>
			Packet-switched networks (which transport packets) are in many ways similar to transportation networks of highways, roads, and intersections (which transport vehicles).<br>
			End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university ISPs; and ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee
shops, and other public places. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links.<br>
			ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL,high-speed local area network access, wireless access, and 56 kbps dial-up modem
access. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting Websites directly to the Internet. 
			The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected.
			These lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs such as Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT.
			An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links. Each ISP network, whether upper-tier or lower-tier, is managed
independently, runs the IP protocol (see below), and conforms to certain naming and address conventions.<br>
			End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. <br>
			The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. <br>
			The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. <br>
			The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP.<br>
			Given the importance of protocols to the Internet, it’s important that everyone agree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and products that interoperate. <br>
			This is where standards come into play. Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)[IETF 2012].<br>
			The IETF standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs). RFCs started out as general requests for comments (hence the name) to resolve network
			and protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the Internet [Allman 2011].<br>
			RFCs tend to be quite technical and detailed. They define protocols such as TCP, IP, HTTP (for the Web), and SMTP (for e-mail).

			<a style="font-weight:bold">2) networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications
</a>
		</p>

				<p class="ex">
			These applications include electronic mail, Web surfing, social networks, instant messaging, Voiceover-IP (VoIP), video streaming, 
			distributed games, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, television over the Internet, remote login, and much, much more.<br>
			The applications are said to be distributed applications, since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other. <br>
			Importantly, Internet applications run on end systems—they do not run in the packet switches in the network core.<br>
			End systems attached to the Internet provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that specifies 
			how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.<br>
			This Internet API is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination program.
