		<h2><a id="C1">1. CSS for JavaScript </a></h2>
		<p>
			Cascading Style Sheets is the W3C standard for defining the presentation of documents written in HTML, and any XML language.<br>
			CSS section:<br>
			<a href="css1.html"> 1) Orientation </a><br>
			<a href="css2.html"> 2) Formatting Text </a><br>
			<a href="css3.html"> 3) Colors & Background </a><br>

			<h2><a id="C2">2. Background Information</a></h2>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">1) History</a><br>
			<span class="para">JavaScript was created at Netscape(1995.Mosaic) <br>
			Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA(the European Computer Manufacturer's Asociation),<br>
			then the standardized version of the language was stuck with the awkward name "ECMAScript" <br>
			The only version numbers that are relevant are ECMAScript versions 3 or 5.<br>
			JavaScript version number means Mozilla's version numbers; version 1.5 is basically ECMAScript 3,<br>
			and later versions include nonstandard language extensions.<br>
			Extended version numbers attached to particular JavaScript interpreters or "engins." (Google calls its JavaScript interpreter V8.)</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="font-weight:bold">2) Background</a><br><span class="para">
				Every language must have a platform or standard library or API of functions for performing things like basic input and output.<br>
			The core JavaScript language defines a minimal API for working with text, arrays, dates, and regular expressions, <br>
			but does not include any input or output functionality. <br>
			Input and output (as well as more sophisticated features, such as networking, storage, and graphics) are the responsibility of the “host environment” within which JavaScript is embedded.
			</span>
		</p>
		<h2><a id="C3">3. Core Java Script</a></h2>
		<p>
			Core Java Script dive into JavaScript at the lowest level.<br>
			<br>
			<a href="J1.html"> 1) Lexical Structure:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It explains things like JavaScript comments, semicolons, and the Unicode character set.
			</span>
			<br>
			<a href="J2.html"> 2) Types, Values, and Variables:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It explains JavaScript variables and the values you can assign to those variables.
			</span><br>
			<a href="J3.html"> 3) Objects & Arrays:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				They are important types that JavaScript programs can manipulate are objects and arrays.
			</span><br>
			<a href="J4.html"> 4) Expressions & Operators:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				An expression ,such as Objects&Arrays, is a phrase of JavaScript that can be evaluated to produce a value.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 5) Statements:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				If the phrases of JavaScript are expressions, then the full sentences are statements.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 6) Function:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It is a named and parametrized block of JavaScript code that you define once,and can then invoke over and over again.<br>
			<a class="additional">* When we combine functions with objects, we get methods.</a>
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 7) Classes & Modules:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				They cover object-oriented programming in JavaScript in detail.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 8) Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				They explain the regular expression grammar and demonstrates how to use these “regexps” for textual pattern matching.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 9) JavaScript Subsets & Extensions:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				They cover subsets and extensions of core JavaScript.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 10) Server-Side JavaScript:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				They introduce two ways to use JavaScript outside of web browsers.
			</span><br>
		</p>

		<h2><a id="C4">4. Client-Side JavaScript</a></h2>
		<p>
			Client-side JavaScript does not exhibit the nonlinear cross-reference problem nearly to
			the extent that the core language does, and it is possible to learn how to use JavaScript
			in web browsers in a fairly linear sequence.<br></p>
		<p>

			<a href="cs1.html"> 1) The Window Object: </a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It explains techniques for scripting the web browser and covers some important global functions of client-side JavaScript.
			</span><br>
			<a href="cs2.html"> 2) Scripting Documents: </a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It gets down to the real business of client-side Java-Script, scripting HTML document content. It shows you how to select particular HTML elements from within a document, how to set HTML attributes of those elements, how to alter the content of those elements, and how to add new elements to the document.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 4) Scripting CSS:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It shows how you can use JavaScript with the CSS styles that define the presentation of that content. JavaScript allows us to script the HTML content and CSS presentation of documents
in web browsers, but it also allows us to define behavior for those documents with event handlers.<br>
				<a class="additional"> * An event handler is a JavaScript function that we register with the browser and the browser invokes when some specified type of event occurs.</a>
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 5) Handling Events:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				They explain how you can define and register event handlers and how the browser invokes them when events occur.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 6) The jQuery Library:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
			 jQuery defines a clever and easy-to-use API for scripting document content, presentation, and behavior. It has been thoroughly tested and works in all major browsers, including old ones like IE6.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 7) Scripted HTTP:</a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It explains how to make scripted HTTP requests with JavaScript—a kind of networking API.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 8) Client-Side Storage: </a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It describes mechanisms for storing data—and even entire applications—on the client side for use in future browsing sessions.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 9) Scripted Media and Graphics: </a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It covers a clientside API for drawing arbitrary graphics in an HTML "canvas" tag.
			</span><br>
			<a href="#"> 10) HTML5 APIs: </a><br>
			<span class="para_list">
				It covers an assortment of new web app APIs specified by or affiliated with HTML5. Networking, storage, graphics: these are OS-type services being provided by the web browser, defining a new cross-platform application environment.<br>
			<a class="additional"> * If you are targeting browsers that support these new APIs, it is an exciting time to be a client-side JavaScript programmer.</a>
			</span><br>

		<h2><a id="C1"> 5. Basic Concepts </a></h2>
		<p> JavaScript is the programming language of the Web; HTML is to specify the content of webpages,CSS is to specify the presentation of webpages, and JavaScript to specify the behavior of webpages.</p>
		<p> <a style="font-weight:bold"> 1) high-level programming language</a><br><span class="para">Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses, and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. </span></p>
		<p><a style="font-weight:bold">  2) dynamic programming language</a><br><span class="para">A dynamic programming language is a class of high-level programming languages, which at runtime execute many common programming behaviours that static programming languages perform during compilation. These behaviors could include an extension of the program, by adding new code, by extending objects and definitions, or by modifying the type system.</span></p>
		<p> <a style="font-weight:bold"> 3) untyped interpreted programming language</a><br><span class="para">Untyped languages, also known as dynamically typed languages, are programming languages that do not make you define the type of a variable.</span></p>
		<p> <a style="font-weight:bold"> 4) application programming interface, API</a><br><span class="para"> The API is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.</span></p>
		<p> <a style="font-weight:bold"> 5) HyperText Markup Language5, HTML5</a><br><span class="para"> HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.</span></p>
		<p> <a style="font-weight:bold"> 6) Object-oriented programming, OOP</a><br><span class="para">  OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</span></p>
